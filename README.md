#  Eniac Data Science Project: Brazilian Market Expansion

## Project Overview:

------------
Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, is considering an expansion into the Brazilian market. As part of this initiative, the company is exploring a 3-year contract with Magist, a potential partner in the region. The goal is to test the market, create brand awareness, and explore the option of setting up its own supply chain management.

#### However there are two main concerns:
####  1.Product Compatibility:               
Eniac's current catalog is 100% tech products, heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories.
It's not clear if Magist is a suitable partner for high-end tech products.
#### 2.Delivery Speed:
   Among Eniac's priorities for customer satisfaction, fast deliveries are crucial.
   The delivery fees resulting from Magist's deal with the public Post Office might be cost-effective,    
   but there's uncertainty about the speed of deliveries.

### Data Insights:

------------
Through data analysis using SQL and Tableau, several insights have been uncovered:

  -  #### Expertise and Experience  with High-End Tech Products: 
          Only 14.67% of Magist's products are tech-related, and the average price of these products is $120.5. 
          Out of 32,951 products sold by Magist, only 3,390 are tech products.
          Magist has limited expertise and experience with high-end tech products.Out of 15,798 products, only 175 are considered expensive.

-    #### Magist's Average & Estimated Delivery Time:

          Magist has an estimated delivery time of up to 140 days, but orders are often delivered earlier.
