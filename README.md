Eniac Data Science Project: Brazilian Market Expansion

Project Overview:

Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, is considering an expansion into the Brazilian market. As part of this initiative, the company is exploring a 3-year contract with Magist, a potential partner in the region. The goal is to test the market, create brand awareness, and explore the option of setting up its own supply chain management.

However, there are two main concerns within the company:

    Product Compatibility:
        Eniac's current catalog is 100% tech products, heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories.
        It's not clear if Magist is a suitable partner for high-end tech products.
        Delivery Speed: Among Eniac's priorities for customer satisfaction, fast deliveries are crucial.
        The delivery fees resulting from Magist's deal with the public Post Office might be cost-effective, but there's uncertainty about the speed of deliveries.

  Data Insights

     Through data analysis using SQL and Tableau, several insights have been uncovered:

      Magist's Average Delivery Time   :   The average delivery time for Magist is 12.5 days.

      Comparison with Apple Store      :    Apple Store offers delivery within 1 to 7 business days. 
                                            Only 14.67% of Magist's products are tech-related, and the average price of these products is $120.5. 
                                            Out of 32,951 products sold by Magist, only 3,390 are tech products.

    Magist's Estimated Delivery Time   :    Magist has an estimated delivery time of up to 140 days, but orders are often delivered earlier.

    Expertise with High-End Tech Products: Magist has limited expertise and experience with high-end tech products. Out of 15,798 products, only 175 are considered expensive.

    Magist's Tech-Oriented Revenue: Magist's revenue from tech products is $40,000.
