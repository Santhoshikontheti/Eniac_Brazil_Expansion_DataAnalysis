#  Eniac Data Science Project: Brazilian Market Expansion

## Project Overview:

------------
Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, is considering an expansion into the Brazilian market. As part of this initiative, the company is exploring a 3-year contract with Magist, a potential partner in the region. The goal is to test the market, create brand awareness, and explore the option of setting up its own supply chain management.

#### However there are two main concerns:
####  1.Product Compatibility:               
Eniac's current catalog is 100% tech products, heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories.
It's not clear if Magist is a suitable partner for high-end tech products.
#### 2.Delivery Speed:
   Among Eniac's priorities for customer satisfaction, fast deliveries are crucial.
   The delivery fees resulting from Magist's deal with the public Post Office might be cost-effective,    
   but there's uncertainty about the speed of deliveries.

### Data Insights:

------------
Through data analysis using SQL and Tableau, several insights have been uncovered:

  -  #### Expertise and Experience  with High-End Tech Products: 
          Only 14.67% of Magist's products are tech-related, and the average price of these products is $120.5. 
          Out of 32,951 products sold by Magist, only 3,390 are tech products.
          Magist has limited expertise and experience with high-end tech products.Out of 15,798 products, only 175 are considered expensive.
-    #### Magist's Average & Estimated Delivery Time: 
          The average delivery time for Magist is 12.5 days.Comparision with Apple Store: Apple Store offers delivery within 1 to 7 business days.
          Magist has an estimated delivery time of up to 140 days, but orders are often delivered earlier.
-    #### Magist's Tech-Oriented Revenue:
          Magist's revenue from tech products is $40,000.


 ### Repository Structure

- The project repository is organized as follows:

    ##### data/      : Contains raw data used in the analysis.
    ##### sql/        :   SQL scripts used for data processing and analysis.
    ##### tableau/    : Tableau workbooks and visualizations.
    ##### docs/      : Documentation files, including this README.

### To replicate or extend the analysis:

    1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
    2.Execute SQL scripts in the sql/ directory to process and analyze the data.
    3.Open Tableau workbooks in the tableau/ directory to explore visualizations.

### Results and Recommendations

The final analysis and recommendations will be documented in a detailed report. Based on the insights gained, we will provide a conclusive answer to the question of whether Magist is a suitable partner for Eniac's expansion into the Brazilian market.
